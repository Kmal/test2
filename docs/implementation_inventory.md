# Current C implementation inventory

This inventory is generated from direct source inspection of `src/**/*.c`, `src/CMakeLists.txt`, and `tests/host/run_host_tests.sh`. It is intentionally one row per C implementation file so default firmware wiring, conditional transports, helper-only code, and host coverage cannot be inferred from stale comments.

| Source | Default app link | Host test | Code-derived status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `action_dispatcher.c` | default | yes | Queue-backed rule action dispatcher used by `rule_runtime.c`; BLE, HTTP, IR, local UI, and speaker tone actions are dispatched or fail closed as unsupported. |
| `action_hat.c` | default | yes | HAT actions are deliberately unsupported; capability/action dispatch remains fail-closed. |
| `action_http.c` | default | yes | HTTP POST action helper is used by the app HTTP sender when network readiness is true; host tests cover JSON/config readiness behavior. |
| `action_ir.c` | default | yes | NEC IR send action helper is wired through the app IR sender and validates carrier/repeat/timeout bounds. |
| `action_speaker.c` | conditional | yes | Speaker tone action helper validates bounded tone parameters, initializes the playback-only StickS3 ES8311/I2S path, enables the M5PM1 PYG3 amplifier only during playback, writes PCM tone frames, and fails closed off target. |
| `app_mode.c` | default | yes | Initializes and names the local control app mode used by boot/status state. |
| `app_sound_level_demand.c` | default | yes | Shared sound-capture demand helper that combines enabled sound-rule trigger demand with Web UI telemetry demand before `main.c` starts the single capture service. |
| `app_time.c` | default | yes | Provides timezone storage/formatting and `/api/time` JSON support used by boot and Web UI. |
| `app_wifi.c` | default | yes | Starts station/setup-AP support, Wi-Fi scan/connect/AP/mode APIs, network status JSON, and SNTP sync task. |
| `audio_metrics.c` | default via sound config | yes | Audio level metric/calibration helper source linked by the default `CONFIG_APP_SOUND_LEVEL_TRIGGERS=y` build; consumed by `sound_level_service.c` for live sound rules. |
| `audio_pipeline.c` | helper-only | yes | PCM capture/playback buffer helper source; not linked by the default app component. |
| `audio_resample.c` | helper-only | yes | Audio resampling helper source; not linked by the default app component. |
| `bmi270.c` | default | yes | BMI270 polling-only accelerometer driver and deterministic software motion thresholding used by hardware automation facts. |

| `board_audio.c` | default via sound/speaker config | yes | Capture-only and playback-only audio initializer linked by sound-level trigger or speaker-action builds; `app_main()` uses capture-only for sound rules and `action_speaker.c` uses playback-only for tones. |
| `board_audio_clock.c` | default via sound/speaker config | yes | 16 kHz/12.288 MHz/512 kHz audio clock profile helper linked by sound-level trigger or speaker-action builds. |
| `board_audio_power.c` | default via sound/speaker config | yes | M5PM1 L3B audio rail enable wrapper and PYG3 speaker-amplifier control linked by audio trigger or speaker-action builds while preserving LCD M5PM1 behavior. |
| `board_i2c.c` | default | no | ESP-IDF shared I2C bus initializer used by LCD/status UI paths and available to board helpers. |
| `board_i2s.c` | default via sound/speaker config | yes | Capture-only/playback-only I2S driver source linked by sound-level trigger or speaker-action builds; includes 32-bit-slot mono `int16_t` decode helper and pin-configuration coverage. |
| `button_state.c` | default | yes | Active-low KEY1/KEY2 debouncing and event classification for status UI and automation facts. |
| `capability_registry.c` | default | yes | Central capability gate for supported/disabled sources/actions and safe GPIO profile validation. |

| `es8311.c` | default via sound/speaker config | yes | ES8311 codec profile driver source linked by sound-level trigger or speaker-action builds; capture-only setup keeps the DAC muted/down while playback-only setup enables DAC output for bounded tones. |
| `hardware_fact_service.c` | default | yes | Unified hardware fact polling service that emits independently gated battery-percent, USB/external-power-present, BMI270 motion, and safe ADC voltage facts through the trigger adapter. |
| `m5pm1.c` | default | yes | M5PM1 register helper and LCD/L3B GPIO sequence used by LCD power, with bit-preserving host tests. |
| `main.c` | default | no | Firmware entry point wiring NVS, time, network, status UI, Wi-Fi, rule runtime, BLE transport, and default error/idle policy. |

| `rule_engine.c` | default | yes | Rule condition evaluation, false-to-true firing, sustain, cooldown, action fan-out, and sequence assignment. |
| `rule_runtime.c` | default | yes | Runtime bridge from button/GPIO/BLE/Wi-Fi/sound facts to rule engine and action dispatcher; the default sound service feeds live metrics through this existing path. |
| `rule_types.c` | default | yes | Rule defaults, validation, source/action names, safe GPIO/capability checks, and binary config serialization. |
| `rule_web.c` | default | yes | On-demand HTTP Web UI/API implementation for config, status, time, Wi-Fi, capabilities, test actions, GPIO, and HAT probe. |
| `sound_level_service.c` | default via sound config | yes | Demand-driven capture task/service source linked by default sound-level trigger builds; it reads microphone samples, computes metrics, and feeds sound facts while enabled sound rules or Web UI telemetry demand exist. |
| `status_lcd.c` | default | no | Optional LCD bring-up/render task path behind `CONFIG_APP_STATUS_UI_LCD`; failures are non-fatal. |
| `status_ui.c` | default | no | Status UI task, active-low KEY1/KEY2 polling, global input queueing, focused keyboard/scan/menu/idle dispatch, launcher/menu integration, toasts, service enablement, and automation config callbacks. |
| `status_ui_input_map.c` | default | yes | Pure helper mapping physical KEY1/KEY2 gestures to global `STATUS_UI_INPUT_*` values; KEY1 long remains outside this map to preserve the idle menu-open exception. |

| `uac_config.c` | conditional | yes | USB Audio Class mode/config resolver linked only by explicit UAC builds; validates mic-only, speaker-only, combined descriptor, simultaneous mic+speaker, sample-rate, ring-buffer, and safe-volume policy. |
| `uac_device_adapter.c` | conditional | yes | Callback-safe UAC adapter linked only by explicit UAC builds; maps descriptor direction plans to ring-buffer input/output callbacks and clamps volume without touching codec/I2S in callbacks. |
| `uac_esp_device.c` | conditional | no | Thin ESP-IDF adapter linked only by explicit UAC builds; maps the project adapter to Espressif `usb_device_uac` fields (`input_cb`, `output_cb`, mute, volume, context, and TinyUSB init flag). |
| `uac_mic_source.c` | conditional | yes | USB microphone PCM source linked only by explicit UAC builds; reuses the existing capture-only ES8311/I2S path and exposes bounded host-tested reads/stats. |
| `uac_speaker_sink.c` | conditional | yes | USB speaker PCM sink linked only by explicit UAC builds; reuses the existing playback-only ES8311/I2S path, requires audio power, and clamps volume below 75%. |
| `uac_service.c` | conditional | yes | Opt-in USB Audio Class service linked only by `CONFIG_APP_USB_UAC_DEVICE`; resolves Kconfig, allocates direction ring buffers, starts the selected board-audio owner, initializes Espressif UAC, and starts microphone/speaker bridge tasks. |
| `ui_keyboard.c` | default | yes | 9-key overlay input model for SSID/password/AP/time fields, including explicit cancel result support and menu-edit cancel metadata coverage. |
| `ui_model.c` | default | no | Menu/application model for Wi-Fi, AP, Bluetooth, automation editing, Web UI service state, and time settings. |
| `ui_nav.c` | default | yes | Menu graph/navigation state machine for the status UI. |
| `ui_render.c` | default | no | LCD rendering of status bar, menus, Wi-Fi/AP/BLE/automation/settings screens, toasts, and keyboard overlay. |
