# Status UI input refactor review

This review records the follow-up audit of the status UI button/input refactor
against the StickS3 hardware references, the original focused-input
architecture plan, and the repository documentation/comment update policy.

## Review result

No additional StickS3 hardware-spec mismatch was found in the touched status UI
input code. The refactor keeps the board facts in `src/board/board_sticks3.h`
unchanged and confines button-gesture changes to software routing. The original
status UI input architecture requirements are implemented, except for optional
module/gesture extraction items that the original plan explicitly allowed to be
left for a follow-up. Documentation and comments were updated to describe the new
input flow and the UI-state-blind physical gesture boundary.

The one validation gap is environmental: the current container still does not
provide ESP-IDF, so `idf.py build` cannot be executed here.

## Official/reference material checked

The review used the repository hardware notes and the official/source references
below. Board facts were cross-checked against `src/board/board_sticks3.h` and the
machine-readable board manifest where applicable.

## Hardware/spec conformance check

| Area | Reviewed implementation | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User buttons | `BOARD_BUTTON_KEY1_GPIO` remains GPIO11, `BOARD_BUTTON_KEY2_GPIO` remains GPIO12, and `BOARD_BUTTON_ACTIVE_LEVEL` remains active-low. | Matches StickS3 button/pin-map docs. |
| Non-button pins | GPIO35, GPIO37, and GPIO39 are still not configured as status buttons; GPIO39 remains LCD MOSI. | Matches repository hardware notes and official pin map. |
| Display | ST7789P3 135x240 pin constants remain MOSI=GPIO39, SCLK=GPIO40, RS/DC=GPIO45, CS=GPIO41, RST=GPIO21, BL=GPIO38. | Matches StickS3 display/pin-map docs. |
| I2C devices | Shared bus and device-address constants for BMI270 and M5PM1 were not changed by this refactor. | No new mismatch introduced. |
| Audio/codec pins | ES8311/I2S constants were not changed by this refactor. | No new mismatch introduced. |
| Bluetooth capability | No Bluetooth stack behavior was changed; ESP32-S3 Classic Bluetooth remains unsupported and custom BLE GATT remains the intended path. | No new mismatch introduced. |

## Original plan / acceptance checklist

| Requirement | Status | Evidence / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keep `status_ui_input_t` as `SELECT`, `NEXT`, `PREV`, `BACK`. | Done | `src/ui/status_ui.h`. |
| Rename menu-specific queue helper to a global queue helper. | Done | `status_ui_queue_global_input()` in `src/ui/status_ui.c`. |
| Physical KEY1 short, KEY2 single, KEY2 double, KEY2 long dispatch only global inputs. | Done | Dispatchers call `status_ui_input_from_physical_gesture()` and then queue the resulting `STATUS_UI_INPUT_*`. |
| Physical dispatchers do not inspect keyboard/menu/scan foreground state. | Done | The short/single/double/long dispatchers no longer call keyboard/menu handlers or inspect UI focus; the KEY1-long exception delegates to a UI-owned helper instead of reading `s_ui.menu_active` in GPIO polling. |
| Preserve KEY1 long menu-open behavior. | Done | KEY1 long remains the explicit exception, but GPIO polling now delegates the UI-state check/open to `status_ui_handle_key1_long()` so the physical polling path stays UI-state blind. |
| Move idle KEY1/KEY2 callback behavior into idle global input handling. | Done | Idle consumer sets deferred callback effects for `SELECT` and `NEXT`. |
| Collect side effects in an input-effects struct and apply them after routing. | Done | `status_ui_input_effects_t` plus `status_ui_apply_input_effects()`. |
| Make `status_ui_handle_input()` the global entry point. | Done | It dispatches focused input and then applies collected effects. |
| Dispatch focused input by keyboard, scan, menu, idle priority. | Done | `status_ui_dispatch_focused_input()`. |
| Keyboard/input overlay consumes global inputs explicitly. | Done | `status_ui_keyboard_consume_input()` handles `SELECT`, `NEXT`, `PREV`, `BACK`. |
| Menu-edit keyboard handling maps global inputs directly. | Done | `status_ui_keyboard_handle_menu_global_input()` maps global inputs to keyboard operations/cancel. |
| Blocking read-line keyboard queue accepts global inputs. | Done | `s_virtual_keyboard_queue` stores `status_ui_input_t`. |
| Remove public keyboard-specific Back/navigation event contract. | Done | Public `STATUS_UI_KEYBOARD_EVENT_*` enum is removed from `ui_keyboard.h`. |
| Add explicit keyboard cancel metadata. | Done | `ui_keyboard_menu_edit_t` has `back_on_cancel`, `has_cancel_target`, `cancel_target`, and `opened_screen`. |
| Remove cancel dependency on `screen->item_count == 0u`. | Done | No status UI keyboard cancel logic uses that heuristic. |
| Set cancel policy for keyboard open paths. | Done | Wi-Fi, manual SSID/password, AP name/password/channel open paths pass explicit cancel policy. |
| Scan screen consumes global input. | Done | `status_ui_scan_consume_input()` handles scan select/next/prev and lets Back fall through to menu navigation. |
| Menu consumes global input. | Done | `status_ui_menu_consume_input()` handles active-menu select/next/prev/back and preserves Web UI exit-screen Back service-disable behavior for Web UI Wi-Fi/AP result screens only. |
| Idle fallback consumes global input. | Done | `status_ui_idle_consume_input_to_effects()` handles idle `SELECT` and `NEXT` callback paths. |
| Keep ISR/UI separation strict. | Done | No ISR code was introduced; a code comment now documents that GPIO polling/future ISR paths must not inspect UI focus or run cleanup. |
| Optional module split. | Not done (optional) | The original plan allowed leaving this as a follow-up. |
| Optional full gesture-recognition extraction. | Partially done (optional) | Full debounce/gesture state remains in `status_ui.c`; only the pure physical gesture-to-global-input mapper was extracted for host coverage. |

### Intentional behavior resolution

The original task text contained both an idle-callback preservation requirement
and a menu-consumer suggestion that could be read as opening the menu whenever a
global input arrives while the menu is inactive. The implementation follows the
required behavior table and idle-callback acceptance criteria: when no foreground
layer is active and the menu is inactive, `STATUS_UI_INPUT_SELECT` and
`STATUS_UI_INPUT_NEXT` go to the existing KEY1/KEY2 idle callback path; KEY1 long
remains the preserved menu-open gesture.

## Documentation/comment update checklist

| File | Update |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/hardware/sticks3/sticks3_button.md` | Documents the global input contract for StickS3 KEY1/KEY2 gestures and links the input mapper/review. |
| `docs/implementation_inventory.md` | Lists `status_ui_input_map.c` and updates `status_ui.c` / `ui_keyboard.c` summaries. |
| `docs/README.md` | Links this status UI input review from the hardware/reference section. |
| `src/ui/status_ui.c` | Documents that physical gesture dispatch must remain UI-state blind and that foreground cleanup belongs to focused input handling. |
| `tests/host/run_host_tests.sh` | Builds and runs the new input-mapping host test. |
| `src/CMakeLists.txt` | Includes the new mapper source in the firmware component. |

## Test coverage status

Implemented host coverage:

- `tests/host/test_status_ui_input_map.c` verifies the physical gesture to
  global input mapping for KEY1 short, KEY2 single, KEY2 double, and KEY2 long,
  and verifies KEY1 long remains outside that mapping.
- `tests/host/test_ui_keyboard.c` verifies keyboard cancel commits pending
  multi-tap state and records cancel metadata explicitly.

Validation commands used for this review:

- `python3 tools/check_docs_consistency.py`
- `python3 tools/check_source_inventory.py`
- `./tests/host/run_host_tests.sh`
- `git diff --check`

Known validation limitation:

- The full firmware build could not be run in the current container because the
  ESP-IDF `idf.py` command is not installed.
