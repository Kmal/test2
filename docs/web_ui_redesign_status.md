# Web UI redesign status

This file records the code-review status of the phased Web UI redesign so reviewers can tell which parts are complete and which are still future work.

## Current shipped scope

The current implementation is a **Phase 0 + Phase 1 foundation only**:

- Resource budgets are documented and statically checked.
- The previous monolithic `s_rule_setup_page` C string has been extracted into `webui/` source files.
- `webui/build_webui.py` generates checked-in `generated/webui_assets.c` and `generated/webui_assets.h`.
- The firmware serves `GET /` from the generated const asset without allocating the large API response buffer used by JSON routes.
- Existing `/api/*` behavior is intended to remain unchanged.
- Host validation checks generated-asset freshness and Web UI size budgets before running host tests.

## Phase checklist

| Phase | Status | Review notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 — hard resource budgets | Complete for initial budgets | `docs/web_ui_resource_budget.md` documents current HTTP/body/response/route/stack values, accepted budgets, and measured Phase 1 asset sizes. |
| Phase 1 — extract current Web UI | Complete for single-document mode | The UI remains behavior-equivalent and is emitted as one generated HTML asset because the route table already uses the 17 configured URI-handler slots. |
| Phase 2 — modern visual system | Not started | No redesigned dark console layout or component vocabulary beyond the existing compact page. |
| Phase 3 — hash router | Not started | No `/#dashboard`, `/#network`, or section router exists yet. |
| Phase 4 — Dashboard command center | Not started | Current page still shows the legacy compact setup/status layout. |
| Phase 5 — guided Network provisioning | Not started | Existing Wi-Fi controls remain; no stepper-style guided redesign yet. |
| Phase 6 — Automation workspace | Not started | Current UI remains single-rule oriented and does not yet implement a multi-rule workspace. |
| Phase 7 — first-class Capabilities page | Not started | Capabilities remain exposed in existing controls/raw panels only. |
| Phase 8 — Diagnostics redesign | Not started | Raw developer tools have not been moved into a dedicated diagnostics page. |
| Phase 9 — Settings/security posture | Not started | Future auth/pairing hooks and security copy are not implemented yet. |
| Phase 10 — resource-safe full config backend | Not started | `/api/config/op` and bounded mutation operations are not implemented yet. |
| Phase 11 — performance/failure testing | Partial static only | Static asset and host checks exist; real StickS3 heap/hardware validation is still required. |

## Review outcome

The Phase 0/1 code review found no intentional API behavior changes. The remaining risk areas before later phases are:

1. Hardware measurement is still required for true peak heap impact.
2. The UI source files are extracted but still compact because Phase 1 preserved behavior rather than redesigning.
3. Future phases must keep `tools/check_web_ui_budget.py` and this status document updated when adding routes, assets, polling, or backend APIs.
